Self-Service Portal Project for manufacturers and resellers
-----------

Redress is a basic customer self-service portal for VARs and OEMS.
List your products with description, pictures, links, upload user manuals, and drivers.

This is a complete rewrite of the original project.


todo: edit this:
A visitor is first met with any marketing information, and contact information
of how to get phone assistance or remote tech support (optional).

At this point the main functionality of the app is to list products
and list downloadable documents like user guides, manuals, as well as drivers
and utilities. As an option, videos can be added either by uploading, or embedding.
visitors can then chose their product and download the appropriate documentation or
utilities.

This is a work-in-progress project. Being developed for a value-added-reseller;
Dealing with many different products, a lot of value-added components of a complete
system need to have supporting implemintation documentation which sometimes is not 
availble elsewhere.

The project is being developed with open-source license in hopes to add further
functionality in the future. Some of this functionality could be issue tracking,
product tracking. Generating printable barcode label for customers to scan and
direct to specific product page, where they will be able to see any warranty information
as well as service contracts, etc.
